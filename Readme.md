# Pixel Climber

A challenging vertical scrolling platformer built with Phaser 3 and Electron. Climb as high as you can while avoiding falling debris and managing your health!

## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Gameplay

- **Vertical Climbing**: Navigate upward through procedurally generated platforms
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic jumping with momentum and run-up mechanics
- **Health System**: Take damage from falls and debris hits
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for every meter climbed

### Advanced Mechanics

- **Run-up Momentum**: Build speed for longer horizontal jumps (trade height for distance)
- **Fall Damage**: Large drops will hurt you - land carefully!
- **Debris Hazards**: Avoid falling rocks that spawn from above
- **Smart Platform Generation**: Mathematically guaranteed reachable platforms with proper spacing

### Visual & Audio

- **Pixel Art Style**: Crisp 32x48 pixel character and detailed environments
- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Multi-layer mountain scenery that moves with your climb
- **Procedural Audio**: Dynamic sound effects and ambient music generated in real-time
- **Smooth Camera**: Follows your ascent with proper bounds

## 🎯 Gameplay Tips

1. **Master the Run-up**: Hold left/right while jumping for maximum horizontal distance
2. **Watch Your Landing**: Falls from great heights cause damage
3. **Dodge Debris**: Falling rocks spawn regularly - stay alert!
4. **Plan Your Route**: Platforms are spaced to challenge your jumping skills
5. **Manage Health**: Your health bar shows current status - avoid taking unnecessary damage

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **A/D**: Move left/right
- **Up Arrow** or **Spacebar**: Jump
- **🔊/🔇 Button**: Toggle audio on/off
